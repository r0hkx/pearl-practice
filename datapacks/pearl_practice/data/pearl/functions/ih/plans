functional requirements before release:
1. remove end island
2. confirm proper landing
3. score display
4. sounds
5. min and max distance
6. fall detection

things that would be nice:
1. hardcore
    miss pearl = reset
2. inventory
3. pearl timeout
4. saved high score
5. distance scoring
    score not based on successful throws, but total distance traveled. weighting longer pearl throws more highly
6. pearls thrown stat
    at reset or death

extras/cosmetics (no order):
a. pearl trails
    customizable items or particles that follow the pearl
b. accuracy rating based on distance from pearl to center of island
    couldn't be from center because you usually want to aim pearl at the back (missed pearl voids, close pearl hits and kills you)
c. ridable pearls
d. practice mode   
    user selected distance
    persistant pearl trails
    

speedrun mode:
    speedrun a certain score in as little time and few pearls as possible
