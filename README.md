## notes for contributors

the world is meant to not matter for this project. the only files that are included are the datapack, structures, and the level.dat. all other world files should be in gitignore, but make sure to not push any garbage. also do not unintentionally commit any level.dat changes unless they're intentional and useful.

that being said the world is assumed to be a void world (at least in the overworld)
