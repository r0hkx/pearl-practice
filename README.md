minecraft 1.16.1 pearl throwing practice map

## updating instructions

to transfer your high scores and custom inventories to a new version of the map:

1. install new version of the map
2. copy data folder from old world folder to new world folder

the data folder is where all your saved information is located

## notes for contributors

the world is meant to not matter for this project. the only files that are included are the datapack, structures, and the level.dat. all other world files should be in gitignore, but make sure to not push any garbage. also do not unintentionally commit any level.dat changes unless they're intentional and useful.

that being said the world is assumed to be a void world (at least in the overworld)
